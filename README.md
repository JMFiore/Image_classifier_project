# Image_classifier_project

Welcome to the Image_classifier_project !


This is a project to create an image classifier. Using the technique called transfer learning. In this technique, you use a pre-trained neural network to use the feature extractor(called the tail) and you create your classifier suited for your dataset. In this case, the dataset is called flowers and has 102 categories. Here is a link to it https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/. The first function allows you to choose the pre-trained neural network to work with, the number of epochs to train, learning rate, batch size, etc., and train it. as well you can choose to use the GPU. Recommended for faster training. The second script allows you to get the predictions of the names in this case of the flowers and the percentage of each class that the NN classified the image.
